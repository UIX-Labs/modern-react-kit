# Modern React Kit

A professional, batteries-included React starter template, designed for modern web development with best-in-class tooling, scalable architecture, and a focus on DX (Developer Experience). This template is ideal for building robust, production-grade React applications.

---

## Features

- **Vite** for lightning-fast development and build.
- **React 19** with the latest features and strict mode enabled.
- **TypeScript** for type safety and maintainability.
- **TanStack Router** for type-safe, file-based routing.
- **TanStack Query** for powerful, declarative data fetching and caching.
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first, highly customizable styling.
- **ESLint** with a modern, opinionated config for code quality.
- **HMR (Hot Module Replacement)** for instant feedback during development.
- **Devtools** for both TanStack Query and Router, integrated out of the box.
- **FSD (Feature-Sliced Design)** architecture for scalable, maintainable codebases.

## Why These Choices?

### Vite
Chosen for its speed, simplicity, and first-class support for modern JavaScript and TypeScript. Vite's HMR is best-in-class, making development a joy.

### React 19
The latest React version ensures access to the newest features, improved performance, and long-term support.

### TypeScript
Type safety is essential for scaling applications and reducing bugs. The template is fully type-checked, with strict settings.

### TanStack Router
A modern, type-safe router that enables file-based routing, code-splitting, and deep integration with React and TanStack Query. It's designed for large, scalable apps.

### TanStack Query
The industry standard for server state management in React. It simplifies data fetching, caching, and background updates, and works seamlessly with TanStack Router.

### Tailwind CSS
Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development. It keeps your styles consistent and maintainable, and is highly customizable.

### ESLint
Configured with the latest community standards and strict rules, including React and TypeScript best practices, to ensure code quality and consistency.

### FSD (Feature-Sliced Design)
Feature-Sliced Design is a modern architecture pattern for frontend projects. It organizes code by features and layers (entities, features, shared, widgets, pages, app), making large codebases scalable and maintainable. This template is ready for FSD, so you can grow your project with confidence.

## Project Structure

```
src/
  app/
    app.tsx           # Main App component, sets up providers (TanStack Query, Router)
    index.tsx         # Entry point, renders <App />
    index.css         # Tailwind CSS import
    routeTree.gen.ts  # Auto-generated by TanStack Router (do not edit)
    routes/           # File-based routes
      __root.tsx      # Root layout for routes
      index.tsx       # Example route ("/")
  index.ts            # App bootstrap
  # FSD layers (add as your app grows):
  entities/
  features/
  shared/
  widgets/
  pages/
```

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Preview the production build:**
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

5. **Lint your code:**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

---

## Customization

- **Routing:** Add new routes in `src/app/routes/` using TanStack Router's file-based convention.
- **Styling:** Edit `src/app/index.css` or use Tailwind's configuration to customize your design system.
- **ESLint:** Tweak rules in `eslint.config.mjs` to match your team's preferences.
- **FSD:** Organize your code by FSD layers (entities, features, shared, widgets, pages) for scalable architecture.

---

## Devtools

- **TanStack Query Devtools** and **TanStack Router Devtools** are included for debugging and inspecting your app's data and navigation state.

---

## Extending

- Add more TanStack Query features (mutations, infinite queries, etc.) as needed.
- Integrate additional Vite plugins for PWA, testing, or analytics.
- Expand ESLint with plugins for accessibility, security, or custom rules.
- Grow your codebase using FSD principles for long-term maintainability.
