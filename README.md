## 🤔 Why These Choices?

### ⚡ [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
Chosen for its speed, simplicity, and first-class support for modern JavaScript and TypeScript. Vite's HMR is best-in-class, making development a joy.

### ⚛️ [React 19](https://react.dev/)
The latest React version ensures access to the newest features, improved performance, and long-term support.

### 🟦 [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
Type safety is essential for scaling applications and reducing bugs. The template is fully type-checked, with strict settings.

### 🗺️ [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/v1)
A modern, type-safe router that enables file-based routing, code-splitting, and deep integration with React and TanStack Query. It's designed for large, scalable apps.

### 🔥 [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v5)
The industry standard for server state management in React. It simplifies data fetching, caching, and background updates, and works seamlessly with TanStack Router.

### 🎨 [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development. It keeps your styles consistent and maintainable, and is highly customizable.

### 🧩 [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
A collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable React components built on top of Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. Use these to quickly build modern UIs with best practices out of the box.

### 🧹 [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
Configured with the latest community standards and strict rules, including React and TypeScript best practices, to ensure code quality and consistency. **ESLint is also used for formatting, replacing the need for Prettier.**

### 🏗️ FSD (Feature-Sliced Design)
Feature-Sliced Design is a modern architecture pattern for frontend projects. It organizes code by features and layers (entities, features, shared, widgets, pages, app), making large codebases scalable and maintainable. This template is ready for FSD, so you can grow your project with confidence.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

```
src/
  app/
    app.tsx           # Main App component, sets up providers (TanStack Query, Router)
    index.tsx         # Entry point, renders <App />
    index.css         # Tailwind CSS import
    routeTree.gen.ts  # Auto-generated by TanStack Router (do not edit)
    routes/           # File-based routes
      __root.tsx      # Root layout for routes
      index.tsx       # Example route ("/")
  index.ts            # App bootstrap
  # FSD layers (add as your app grows):
  entities/
  features/
  shared/
  widgets/
  pages/
